__Aerial Refueling Distributed Mission Objective__
* As Project Engineer and Lead Software Engineer, spearheaded the development of the first networked, high fidelity aerial refueling training system.
  * Designed a robust network interface, written in C++, between two or more simulation systems.
  * Implemented, in C and FORTRAN, physical model based algorithms to accurately position multiple networked aircraft in a single virtual environment.
  * Updated a C++ based touchscreen GUI using Visual Studio to provide access to new network functionality.

__Boom Operator Simulation System__
* As Software Engineer, lead head tracking system integration and assisted with visual system upgrade.
  * Using a third party hardware system and SDK, wrote an interface in C++ to upgrade a high fidelity boom operator trainer to include a head tracking system.
  * Upgraded visual system with new TVs and projectors by assisting with calculations to achieve the correct field of view for the physical layout of screens.

__Boom Operator Weapon System Trainer__
* Software engineer in charge of cockpit systems and visual model database, also assisted with aircraft navigation.
  * In a Linux based C++ development environment, built cockpit system from the ground up, including interfacing physical buttons with I/O computer system, and modeling electrical and hydraulic systems based on technical diagrams from aircraft
  * Coordinated with another contractor to update visual model database. This included writing object oriented software to articulate moving parts and other features on 21 different aircraft models to simulate real world movements.
  * Developed an algorithm to fly a simulated aircraft to a waypoint while in autopilot so that the aircraft would properly stay on track.

__I/ITSEC__
* Contributed to marketing and customer interaction at I/ITSEC, a large annual military simulation and training conference.
  * In 2011, in charge of managing company’s presence at I/ITSEC. Worked with customers and industry partners to comarket products.
  * In 2012, authored a paper selected for publication about the development of a networked aerial refueling training system. Scheduled to present paper at the conference in Dec 2012.

# Excivity
__Secure Communications Tool Suite__
* As Software Engineer, worked with a distributed team to maintain, improve and add new tools to a suite of applications.

  * Developed custom secure communications tool using Tor’s Stem API which connects to various Tor endpoints around the world to gather data about the global landscape of the Internet.
  * Developed a distributed architecture to spread heavy processing loads across several endpoints with a main controller to merge together resulting data.
  * Harnessed the IMAP and POP protocol to build out an email client to securely and efficiently gather and process thousands of emails across hundreds of accounts.

__Secure Messaging Android Application__
* As Software Engineer, worked with a team to design and develop from concept to deliverable product, a secure messaging application which included an Android application, a cloud based backend and a Java based configuration application.

  * Worked with the Smack API to harness XMPP protocol to facilitate reliable messaging on both Java and Android platforms across several different XMPP providers.
  * Designed and implemented the application password entry page which included User Interface elements as well as a PBKDF2 password implementation.
  * Developed a message stream to display incoming messages and enable the user to compose and send messages securely.

__Secure VOIP Android App__
* As Software Engineer, worked with a team to design and develop from concept to deliverable product, a secure VoIP application on the Android mobile platform which included Android handsets, and a cloud based backend.

  * Designed and developed the first iteration of a secure VoIP module on an Android handset.
  * Interfaced with the Android handset microphone to 1) sample raw voice data and encode the data using an audio codec and to 2) decode audio data and playback through the Android handset speakers.
  * Data transportation also included data encryption, packaging the data using JSON and sending the data as well as receiving and parsing the data on the other side to prepare it for consumption by the audio system.

  __General__
  * Assisted in the shift towards the Agile development process which included the adoption of collaborative development tools, daily team collaboration, frequent releases, and consistent communication with the customer to incorporate feedback into the development cycle.

# XOR Security
__Automated Incident Triage System__
* As Lead DevOps Engineer and Senior Engineer, worked with a team of engineers to build a flexible system to automate the detection, data enrichment and remediation recommendation of malicious network events.
  * As Lead DevOps/Software Engineer, planned, designed and built a secure deployment pipeline considerably lowering the time to deployment from 2+ hours to under 5 minutes. Guided design team to build portable apps suited for multiple environments.  Oversee the constant improvement and maintenance of the deployment pipeline.
  * As Lead Engineer, provide input to guide technical direction and architecture.
  * Developed and integrated Rule Execution Server leveraging JBoss Drools.
